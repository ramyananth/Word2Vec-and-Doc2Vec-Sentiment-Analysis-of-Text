In this project, you will perform sentiment analysis over IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data. 
Your goal will be to classify tweets or movie reviews as either positive or negative. 
Towards this end,you will be given labeled training to build the model  and labeled testing data to evaluate the model. 
For classification, you will experiment with logistic regression as well as 
a Naive Bayes classifier from Pythonâ€™s well-regarded machine learning package scikit-learn.
